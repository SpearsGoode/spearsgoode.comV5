    <h5>Version 0</h5>
    <img src="./img/spearsgoode.comV0.jpg" alt="SpearsGoode.com version 0" class="img-fluid"></img>
    <p>V0 is the first web page I ever made. It was basically just a simple layout using CSS grid and basic HTML and CSS. This was created while watching a tutorial and built on in later versions.</p>

    <h5>Version 1</h5>
    <img src="./img/spearsgoode.comV1.jpg" alt="SpearsGoode.com version 1" class="img-fluid"></img>
    <p>V1 was born when I started getting more and more into learning about coding and I was eager to test out some of my newly acquired skills. I designed my first logo and uploaded a background-image and some artwork. I began messing about with links and menus, and the next thing I knew, my web page was turning into a website. I also started adding content and making plans for what I wanted to do next. In the end, V1 was just a site plan, some artwork, and a description of what I was going to do with the other pages.</p>

    <h5>Version 2</h5>
    <img src="./img/spearsgoode.comV2.jpg" alt="SpearsGoode.com version 2" class="img-fluid"></img>
    <p>V2 was built from scratch looking at V1. I wanted everything to work together correctly, so I did this to avoid any issues that could arise from my sub-par coding in V1. In V2 I added content to every page and removed the photography page so I could focus on more important parts of my website.</p>

    <p>One element that I focused on was the art card layout on the artwork page. I made them look much nicer by nesting a flexbox within the grid items on the main grid instead of trying to use a grid nested within a grid nested within a grid. I also added the downloadable site archive and my first blog post to the programming and blog pages. I also added on-screen navigation to my home and artwork pages because they were beginning to get quite long.</p>

    <p>In later iterations of V2 I set out to make my site look better. I did this by designing a new logo and using the colors in my new logo as the colors for my site. I also went through my code and added padding and margins to a lot of the content to add more white space. I finished the home page layout and made the art card layout that you can see on the artwork page. Once everything looked nice, I resumed adding content to my site. I added a new blog post, an about me, and an interactive site archive. I also started learning JavaScript and created the testing area on the programming page.</p>

    <h5>Version 3</h5>
    <img src="./img/spearsgoode.comV3.jpg" alt="SpearsGoode.com version 3" class="img-fluid"></img>
    <p>V3 was built from scratch looking at V2. I had neglected to build my site mobile first in V2 and as bugs compounded, I realized the only remedy was to start over. I spent, by far, the most time on V3. It is the first version that really felt complete.</p>
    <img src="./img/spearsgoode.comV3-art.jpg" alt="SpearsGoode.com version 3 artwork page" class="img-fluid"></img>
    <p>A lot was added and refined in V3. The most noticeable change was the site design. I spent what felt like countless hours playing with grid and flexbox trying to get everything just right. I also overhauled the color scheme and added a privacy policy and terms of service. The most time consuming change was adding all of my remaining artwork to the site and making sure that each one was labeled correctly. The difficulty I had with this is part of the reason I decided to learn PHP. </p>

    <h5>Version 4</h5>
    <p>Every backup of V4 was unfortunatly lost during my cross country move. The projects page of V4 was nearly identical to V5. V4 also had a page for my artwork and a couple other pages that were never completed. Loosing V4 was very disappointing becasue of how much time and effort went into the projects and artwork pages. I had added all of the info required to generate each art card into a PHP array that could be used to easily add more without having to write any HTML. The page also loaded lightning fast despite the massive amount data required to be fully functional. This was accomplished by first loading a 1kb square as a placeholder for each image. Compressed images were then lazy loaded into the art cards. Each image also contained a button overlay that linked to full sized images that were loaded individually. I plan on recreating this artwork page at some point.</p>

    <h5>Version 5</h5>
    <p>I have learned my lesson and will never start another project without using a VCS. All code for V5 can be found on my GitHub.</p>
